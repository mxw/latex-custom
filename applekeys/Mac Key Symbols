Command symbol is contained in LucidaGrande, Charcoal, Chicago, Osaka, etc., etc. It is said that you can use also Illustrator, but I'm not sure since I don't have it. Anyway, with eps, you can write something like this	\raisebox{-0.12ex}{\includegraphics[width=.8em]{keysymbol/command.eps}}with \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} in Preambules. I don't know what would be the appropriate size in LaTeX though. I'm running a Japanese localised version.If you have difficulty in creating eps from a font, try<http://quinon.com/files/TeX/keysymbol.sit>KinoÊ-----------------------------------------------------Please see <http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/> for listguidelines, information, and LaTeX/TeX resources.
